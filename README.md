hi...there was some problem in the reading of geckodriver and firefox. so i defined a variable with the exact location of firefox in my pc. after that, the code is working just fine and the csv file is being created. if it doesn't work in your pc, it's probably because of that variable. so pls change that variable before you run in your pc
